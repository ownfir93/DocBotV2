Analyze User Input: The user ran app.py (presumably python3 app.py) after installing dependencies from the updated pyproject.toml. They provided the error output.

Analyze the Output:

Initial Startup: Flask-Session configures correctly (Configuring Flask-Session with Redis...). Application startup message appears (ðŸš€ DocBot starting initialization...). Async loop starts. LLM and Embeddings initialize successfully.
Vector Store Loading: The load_vectorstore function starts, creates a temporary directory (/tmp/chroma_index_jhlc_c5l).
GCS Client Initialization Error: The error occurs within load_vectorstore when it calls get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket, which in turn calls storage.Client(). The error is the exact same google.auth.exceptions.TransportError: Failed to retrieve http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/universe/universe-domain... Name or service not known as seen previously in the pipeline script before the explicit credential loading fix was applied there.
Traceback: Shows the error originates from storage.Client() in get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket within app.py.
Consequence: load_vectorstore fails, which causes initialize_app to fail, preventing the server from starting.
Diagnose the Problem: The user successfully fixed the GCS client initialization in build_index_pipeline.py by explicitly loading credentials from the key file and passing them to the storage.Client() constructor. However, the app.py script (as provided earlier by the user) does not contain this same fix. Its get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket function still uses the simple gcs_client_runtime = storage.Client() call, which relies on auto-discovery. This auto-discovery mechanism is failing in Replit because it incorrectly tries (and fails) to contact the metadata server for the universe domain, just like it did in the pipeline script initially.

Formulate the Solution: The user needs to apply the same fix to app.py's GCS client initialization as was applied to build_index_pipeline.py. They need to explicitly load the service account credentials from the temporary key file (created by the Replit secret handler code block, which should be present at the top of app.py as well) and pass both the project and credentials to the storage.Client() constructor within the get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket function in app.py.

Provide Instructions:

Explain the error: State clearly that app.py is encountering the same GCS client initialization error related to the "universe-domain" metadata check that was previously fixed in the pipeline script.
Explain the cause: The get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket function in app.py is still using storage.Client() without explicitly providing the credentials, causing it to fail the same way the pipeline script did initially.
Provide Code Change:
Instruct the user to edit app.py.
Add the import from google.oauth2 import service_account near the top if it's not already there.
Find the get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket function.
Replace the try...except block inside that function with the version that explicitly loads credentials from the file path provided by GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS (which the Replit secret handler should be setting) and passes project and credentials to the client. Provide the corrected code block for the function:
Python

# Add near other google imports if missing:
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Find and Replace this function's try/except block:
def get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket():
    """Initializes GCS client and bucket object using explicit credentials."""
    global gcs_client_runtime, gcs_bucket_runtime
    if gcs_client_runtime is None or gcs_bucket_runtime is None:
        if not GCS_BUCKET_NAME:
             raise ValueError("GCS_BUCKET_NAME not configured for runtime.")

        # --- START REPLACEMENT ---
        try:
            # Get the keyfile path set by the Replit secret handling code
            key_file_path = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")
            if not key_file_path or not os.path.exists(key_file_path):
                 raise ValueError(f"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path ('{key_file_path}') not valid or file missing for runtime.")

            # Explicitly load credentials from the file
            credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(key_file_path)
            logging.info(f"Explicitly loaded runtime credentials from: {key_file_path}")

            # Initialize client with explicit project AND explicitly loaded credentials
            # Ensure GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT env var is set via secrets, or hardcode 'elevado'
            project_id = os.getenv("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT", "elevado")
            gcs_client_runtime = storage.Client(project=project_id, credentials=credentials)

            # Now get the bucket object using the initialized client
            gcs_bucket_runtime = gcs_client_runtime.get_bucket(GCS_BUCKET_NAME)
            logging.info(f"Runtime GCS client initialized and bucket '{GCS_BUCKET_NAME}' accessed.")

        except Exception as e:
            logging.critical(f"Failed explicit runtime GCS init for bucket '{GCS_BUCKET_NAME}': {e}", exc_info=True)
            raise # Re-raise to stop the app initialization
        # --- END REPLACEMENT ---
    return gcs_client_runtime, gcs_bucket_runtime
(Self-correction: Made sure to use gcs_client_runtime and gcs_bucket_runtime vars. Also added reading project ID from env var as fallback).
Confirm Replit Secret Handler: Remind the user to ensure the "Replit Service Account Key Handling" code block is present at the top of app.py just like it was added to the pipeline script, so that the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS env var is correctly set to the temp file path.
Save and Retry: Instruct the user to save app.py and run python3 app.py again.
Refine: Make the instructions very clear about applying the same fix used in the pipeline script to the runtime script (app.py). Provide the exact code block needed for the function. Add the check for the secret handler block.

It looks like you're hitting the exact same GCS client initialization error in app.py that we previously fixed in build_index_pipeline.py:

google.auth.exceptions.TransportError: Failed to retrieve http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/universe/universe-domain ... Name or service not known
Cause:

Your app.py (specifically the get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket function based on the traceback) is still initializing the GCS client using the simple auto-discovery method:

Python

gcs_client_runtime = storage.Client()
As we discovered with the pipeline script, this auto-discovery method fails in your Replit environment because it incorrectly tries to contact the GCE metadata server.

Solution:

You need to apply the exact same fix to app.py that worked for build_index_pipeline.py: explicitly load the credentials from the key file and pass them (along with the project ID) to the storage.Client constructor.

Confirm Secret Handling Code: First, double-check that the "Replit Service Account Key Handling" code block (the one that reads GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON, creates /tmp/keyfile.json, and sets the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable) is present at the very top of your app.py, just like in the pipeline script. This step is essential.

Edit app.py: Open the file in the Replit editor.

Add Import: Make sure this import exists near the top:

Python

from google.oauth2 import service_account
Modify get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket: Find this function (around line 178 in the code you shared earlier) and replace its try...except block with the version below, which explicitly loads credentials:

Python

def get_gcs_runtime_client_and_bucket():
    """Initializes GCS client and bucket object using explicit credentials."""
    global gcs_client_runtime, gcs_bucket_runtime
    if gcs_client_runtime is None or gcs_bucket_runtime is None:
        if not GCS_BUCKET_NAME:
             raise ValueError("GCS_BUCKET_NAME not configured for runtime.")

        # --- START REPLACEMENT ---
        try:
            # Get the keyfile path set by the Replit secret handling code at script start
            key_file_path = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")
            if not key_file_path or not os.path.exists(key_file_path):
                 raise ValueError(f"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path ('{key_file_path}') not valid or file missing for runtime.")

            # Explicitly load credentials from the file
            credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(key_file_path)
            logging.info(f"Explicitly loaded runtime credentials from: {key_file_path}")

            # Initialize client with explicit project AND explicitly loaded credentials
            # Read project ID from env var set via secrets
            project_id = os.getenv("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT")
            if not project_id:
                raise ValueError("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable not set.")

            gcs_client_runtime = storage.Client(project=project_id, credentials=credentials)

            # Now get the bucket object using the initialized client
            gcs_bucket_runtime = gcs_client_runtime.get_bucket(GCS_BUCKET_NAME)
            logging.info(f"Runtime GCS client initialized and bucket '{GCS_BUCKET_NAME}' accessed.")

        except Exception as e:
            logging.critical(f"Failed explicit runtime GCS init for bucket '{GCS_BUCKET_NAME}': {e}", exc_info=True)
            raise # Re-raise to stop the app initialization
        # --- END REPLACEMENT ---
    return gcs_client_runtime, gcs_bucket_runtime
