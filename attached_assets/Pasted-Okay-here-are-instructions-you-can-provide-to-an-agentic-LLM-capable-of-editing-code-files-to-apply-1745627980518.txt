Okay, here are instructions you can provide to an agentic LLM capable of editing code files to apply the fix we discussed for the Self-Query Retriever in your app.py:

Plaintext

Okay Agent, I need you to modify the configuration of the Self-Query Retriever in the Flask application file `app.py` to improve its metadata filtering logic. Please perform the following steps:

1.  **Target File:** Open and prepare to edit the file named `app.py`.

2.  **Locate Primary Variable:** Find the definition of the Python list variable named `metadata_field_info` within the `initialize_app()` function. This list contains `AttributeInfo` objects used to configure the `SelfQueryRetriever`.

3.  **Identify Target Element:** Inside the `metadata_field_info` list, locate the specific `AttributeInfo` object where the `name` parameter is set to the string `'document_type'`.

4.  **Modify Element Description:** Replace the *entire existing value* of the `description` parameter for the `document_type` `AttributeInfo` object with the following new string value:

    ```text
    The category or type of the document, derived from its source folder or filename. Examples include: 'case_study', 'win_report', 'sales_deck', 'one_pager', 'product_marketing', 'enablement', 'discovery_guide', 'deal_desk', 'roi_calculator', 'presentation', 'report', 'highspot_download', 'unknown'. Use this field to filter searches to specific document categories ONLY when the user explicitly asks for a certain type of document.
    ```

5.  **(Optional) Locate Secondary Variable:** Still within the `initialize_app()` function, find the string variable named `document_content_description`.

6.  **(Optional) Modify Secondary Variable:** Replace the current value of the `document_content_description` variable with the following string:

    ```text
    A collection of business and sales documents, including customer case studies, win reports, sales decks, product marketing materials, pricing/deal desk information, one-page summaries, discovery guides, enablement resources, and other reports or presentations.
    ```

7.  **Save Changes:** Save the modifications made to the `app.py` file.

These changes aim to make the descriptions provided to the Self-Query Retriever more accurate and less biased towards specific document types, allowing it to generate more appropriate filters based on diverse user questions.
Important Considerations:

Actual Document Types: Remind the agent (or yourself) that the examples listed in the revised document_type description ('case_study', 'win_report', 'sales_deck', ...) should ideally reflect the actual unique document_type values present in the vector store (which you can find from the startup logs). The provided list is a good general example based on your build script.
Testing: After the agent applies these changes, you will still need to redeploy and test the application with various queries to confirm that the retriever's filtering behavior has improved and it can now answer a wider range of questions. Check the logs (verbose=True should still be active) to see the generated filters.
