The problem they faced was that marketers did not have a way to ideate, collaborate, and share content, with most content being product-focused. The solution was a global asset library that allowed teams to share, repurpose, and reuse content across markets, reducing redundancy and waste. The results were improved content design to serve the customer and assets being shared across teams via a centralized asset library (Source: 5).",

    "question": "What's a good b2b case study to share?",
    "answer": "A good B2B case study to share is about Lenovo, the number one PC manufacturer in the world. Lenovo needed to replace the search functionality on its website, which serves customers in both B2B and B2C markets across over 180 countries in 88 different languages. By implementing Lucidworks Fusion, Lenovo was able to utilize machine learning capabilities and out-of-the-box tools like a rules editor, which significantly improved the personalization and relevance of search results. In the first full year after deploying Fusion on Lenovo.com, annual revenue contribution through search increased by 95%. Additionally, with Fusion signals turned on for just a few months, the relevancy of search results improved by 55% (Source: 3).",

    "question": "What's a good b2b case study to share?",
    "answer": "A good B2B case study to share is the one involving CDW. The case study highlights how Lucidworks helped CDW, a global technology giant, improve its search experience. CDW wanted to create an omnichannel, personalized search experience for its sellers and B2B buyers but was limited by its Endeca-based search engine. By replacing the Endeca engine with Lucidworks search, CDW was able to collect and analyze user behavior signals to personalize the search experience. This resulted in a 3% increase in order conversion rate, a 40% reduction in zero-result searches, and a 10% increase in add-to-cart actions.",
